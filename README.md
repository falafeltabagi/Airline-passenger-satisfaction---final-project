# Airline-passenger-satisfaction---final-project

This project analyzes a dataset of airline passenger satisfaction to explore which factors influence whether a customer is satisfied or not.

## 📊 Project Structure
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics, missing values, correlation, and visual exploration
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers
- **Feature Engineering**: Conversion of categorical variables, label encoding
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance

## 💡 Key Insights
- Travel class, service ratings, and flight distance are strong predictors of satisfaction
- Random Forest performed better than Logistic Regression in our case
- Business class passengers are generally more satisfied

## 📁 File
- `final-project-airline-satisfaction.ipynb`: Main notebook with full code and outputs

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
